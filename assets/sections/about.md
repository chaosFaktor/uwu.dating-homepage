## About UwU dating
UwU dating begin in 2023, when [larsm](https://larsm.org) wrote the first version of the software on his way to the [GPN21](https://entropia.de/GPN). After meeting him there, I was thrilled by the idea, but also noticed some problems in the source code. I went on to rewrite the project during the next few days and published the [new version](https://github.com/larsmm/uwu.dating).

After the convention I took some time to rewrite the project yet another time and move the codebase to [flutter](https://flutter.dev) with a [laravel](https://laravel.com) backend. I am currently working on uncluttering the codebase and improving the chat-system.
