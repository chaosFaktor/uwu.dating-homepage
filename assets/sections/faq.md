## Is this a dating platform?

The primary goal of this platform is to provide an accessible and data-conscious way to meet new people.

Many social apps encourage users to judge others based on looks or a bio without engaging in conversation. While this may help some filter potential friends or activity partners, UwU tours aims to offer a platform for meeting people with fewer preconceived expectations.

UwU tours facilitates meetings in one-on-one scenarios based on shared interests or even at random, promoting social mixing and getting to know different people.

Users can share information about the types of experiences they are interested in on their profiles, allowing others to see this information. However, sharing private or confidential information is neither expected nor desired on this platform.

## How does it work?

As the project is still a work in progress, we appreciate your patience. Currently, you can wait for a preview and provide feedback on any issues. Constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement are highly appreciated. Contributions to the project are welcome, and efforts are being made to streamline the codebase.

## What about my personal information?

You don't need to share personal information!

All that is required is an IP-capable device and some rough information on how to be recognized at the meeting place (e.g., "I am wearing a blue shirt, cat ears, and glasses"). Any additional information is provided only at **your** discretion and only if **you** choose to share it.
