## This is a sex thing - isn't it\!?
Not nescessarily... The main goal of this platform is to allow for an uncomplicated and data-saving way to meet new people.

A central problem, I typically have with dating apps is that they encourage you to judge people based on looks or a bio, but without ever talking to them. Although this certainly has value to some as a means of filtering for potential romantic or sexual partners I was more so going for a way to meet people without too much preceding expectations.

This is why UwU dating focusses on being a platform to easily organise meeting in small groups or for two based on different interests or completely at random, promoting mixing of social groups and getting to know different people.

You can connect some information about what kind of meetings you would be interested in to your profile, so others can see, but any information you consider private or confidential does not belong on the platform\!


## So how does this work?

As the project is still highly work in progress all you can do at the moment is wait for a preview and then grumble about anything I did wrong. As I do not have much experience in discerning the things people would be interested in, I am gratefull for constructive feedback and things you would have liked differently. As I do this just for the fun of it and this project is the first thing to get postponed when I get urgent work to do I am also very open for anyone wanting to [contribute](/contribute) to the project and am currently working around the clock on uncluttering the codebase.

## I don't want to share my personal information\!\!\!\!1\!
And you don't need to\!

All you need to enter is a username and a password, along with some rough information on how to recognise you at the meeting place (e.g. "I am wearing a blue shirt, cat ears and glasses"). Any other information is provided only at **your** discretion and only if **you** want to.
